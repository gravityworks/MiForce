	Our beautiful state contains sites where our soil and water contain high level of containments such as Benzene, Ethylbenzene, and Mercury. There are over 1000 of these sites and they may be in your backyard. Michigan has issued permits for over 56,000 oil and gas wells. These wells often times turn into containmented sites! It is our goal to educate you about where these sites are, using a simple game. 
	
			In this game, we pretend that these sites are on fire, and its your job to extinguish the fire by clicking on the site. Each site that appears is a real location, that may be closer then you think. While playing, watching out for obstacles. Not all icons will gain points.
